# Intro to Python for Xaxis Analytics

**Purpose and Goals**
* For participants to get a base knowledge of Python and be comfortable using Python as a resource for their day to day jobs
* To find a project and apply your Python skills - whether it be automating, data analysis, building a model, etc - the world  is your oyster!

**What this course won't do**
* Make you an expert on Python

**Python Stack**
* We'll be using Jupyter Notebooks and Python 3.7. You should all have this installed on your computers.

**Course Curriculum**
* Course will be a mixture of Lectures/Demos, code-alongs and quizzes, with a final project at the end.
* We will meet once per week for an hour. Please be on-time to meetings so we can start promptly.
* Please feel free to message myself or Sara with any questions about the materials, quizzes, tests or projects.

Weeks 10-11: Capstone Project
Assignment
Take the knowledge that you've gained in the past 9 weeks and put together an analysis with Xaxis data using the Python techniques you've learned in this course. This can be anything from automating a frequent excel report, visualizing data for a wrap up in Python, or any other application you can think of!

Week 12: Capstone Project Presentation Competition
Take your projects, present them to the group in our capstone session, and judges will vote on the winners! Criteria to be determined, but there will be food provided!Python for Xaxis Newbies
